# <h1> **Individual Project MLOps** </h1>
# <h2> **Introduction and objetives of the project** </h2>

In this project i have the objective of transform the datasets provided and find the most valuable variables to make accurate recommendation systems for my API, in which you can also find historical information about steam games and users.

I will divide the process in 4 key tasks:

# <h2> **ETL** </h2>
- Fix nested JSON archives and read them in the right format
- Null values treatment doing web scraping and imputation
- Look for duplicated and wrong formatted values and drop/transform them
- Analyze the datasets and drop useless information
- Save the datasets in the right format
  
To see the process you can visit the [ETL](https://github.com/motm-1/PI_MLOps/blob/main/etl.py)
